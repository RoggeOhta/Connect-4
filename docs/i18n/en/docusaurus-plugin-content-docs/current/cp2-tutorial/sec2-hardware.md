At this point, the hardware installation of the robotic arm is complete.

## Communication Connection

### M5 Version

The robotic arm body and the camera need to be connected to the PC.

Connection port on the robotic arm:

Also make sure that the screen on robot arm's base displaying "Atom : OK"

### Pi Version

For the Pi version of the robotic arm, there is no need to connect to itself. The camera module needs to be connected to the USB port on the robotic arm.
