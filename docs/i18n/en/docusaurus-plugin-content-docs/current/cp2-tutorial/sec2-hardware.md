At this point, the hardware installation of the robotic arm is complete.

## Communication Connection

### M5 Version

The main body of the robotic arm and the camera need to be connected to the PC, with the camera connected to the computer via USB and the robotic arm requiring a Type-C interface cable connection to the computer.

The connection port of the robotic arm:

Ensure that "Atom: OK" is displayed on the robotic arm's screen.

### Pi Version

For the Pi version of the robotic arm, there is no need to connect it to itself. The camera module needs to be connected to the USB port on the robotic arm.
