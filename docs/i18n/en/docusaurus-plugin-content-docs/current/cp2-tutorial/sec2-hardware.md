At this point, the hardware installation of the robotic arm is complete.

## Communication Connection

### M5 Version

The main body of the robotic arm and the camera need to be connected to the PC, with the camera connected to the computer via USB and the robotic arm requiring a Type-C interface cable connection to the computer.

The connection port of the robotic arm:

Ensure that "Atom: OK" is displayed on the robotic arm's screen.

### Pi Version

The installation process for the Pi version of the robotic arm is similar to that of the 280 version, with the only difference being that there is no need to connect to the host computer via a Type-C cable. Additionally, the camera module needs to be connected to the USB port on the robotic arm.

### MyArm

MyArm的安装方式与280类似，需要注意的是相机-下棋装置与机械臂的连接位置略有变化，

同样的，相机需要插在机械臂本体后方的USB插孔上
