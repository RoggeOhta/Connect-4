Before setting up the environment, make sure you have installed Python. If you haven't, please refer to the[Software Environment Setup](/cp2-tutorial/sec1-software.md)

First, go to the[VS Code official website](https://code.visualstudio.com/)and download the installation package for your system. Install it after downloading.
