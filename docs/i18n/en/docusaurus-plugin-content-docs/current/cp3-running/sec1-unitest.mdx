# Unit Testing

## Robot Testing

Open the terminal in root directory. Enter `python .\tests\test1_robot.py` in the terminal.

Follow the prompt to input the serial port for connecting to the robot (enter the corresponding index, e.g., 0 in the above example).

Observe the movement of the robot. If all 6 axes show changes, it indicates that the communication with the robotic arm is functioning properly. If the robot does not move, there may be communication or firmware issues.

## Camera Testing

Open the terminal in root directory. Enter `python .\tests\test2_camera.py` in the terminal.

If the camera has no image, you can try modifying the `cam_index` in `test2_camera.py`. You can attempt numbers like `0, 1, 2, 3`, etc.

Observe if the camera image is clear. If the image is blurry, consider cleaning the lens.

## Chess Trigger Testing

The chess trigger is a special structure fixed to the end of the robotic arm. To test this project, make sure the chess trigger is installed properly and can function correctly.
**Note: Before running the test, make sure the chess trigger is loaded with enough chess pieces (>5).**

Open the terminal in root directory. Enter `python .\tests\test3_tigger.py` in the terminal.

Observe if the chess trigger can push the chess pieces out.

## Robot Movement Point Testing

This test requires the chessboard and robotic arm to be fully installed. The robotic arm will attempt to visit all the points in order. You need to observe the accuracy of the robotic arm reaching each point.

Open the terminal in root directory. Enter `python .\tests\test4_drop_point.py` in the terminal.

If it doesn't meet your expectations, you can manually modify the values in `self.chess_table` within `core\ArmInterface.py`. You can use software like [myBlockly](https://www.elephantrobotics.com/download/) to assist with the operation.

## Image Capture Point Testing

In this test, the robotic arm will automatically move to the observation position. If the QR codes and the relative position of the robotic arm are correct, you will see another window with only the chessboard.

Navigate to the `tests` directory and open the terminal here. Enter `python .\tests\test5_img.py` in the terminal.

If the camera has no image, you can try modifying the `cam_index` in `test5_img.py`. You can attempt numbers like `0, 1, 2, 3`, etc.
