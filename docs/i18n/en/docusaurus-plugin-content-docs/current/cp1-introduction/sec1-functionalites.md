# Supported Features of the Suite

- Visual Capability: Utilizing OpenCV for image processing and machine vision analysis, the suite can perform real-time detection and recognition of the chessboard and chess pieces' positions, ensuring accurate perception of the game state. Through real-time video stream input, the module can capture changes in the game state instantly, providing the latest information for subsequent decision-making.

- Decision-Making Ability: Using a DQN network trained on PyTorch, the module can analyze the current game state, predict and generate the best chess-playing strategies to maximize the likelihood of winning. Through deep reinforcement learning techniques, the module can learn from a large amount of game data and continuously optimize its decision-making ability, gradually improving its level of play. With efficient algorithm design and optimization, the module can perform game analysis and decision-making in a short time, achieving fast and accurate moves.

- Manipulation Capability: Using the MyCobot 280 robotic arm, the module can accurately locate the target position of chess pieces and place them in the specified positions through precise movement operations.
